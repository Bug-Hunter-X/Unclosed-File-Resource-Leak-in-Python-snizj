This repository demonstrates a common Python coding error: forgetting to close a file after opening it.  The `bug.py` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected version.  This can lead to resource exhaustion, especially with many files open simultaneously.  Always ensure proper file closure using `with open(...) as f:` or explicit `f.close()`.
